# virtuGroup

I have changed the Spring Boot version to add some test depedencies.
I wasn't able to finish all of tasks because struggling with Angular JS as its been a while that I have worked on it.
Project has old versions of Spring MVC and Spring Security so had to do a bit of search to understand how it hooks together. 
I have covered basic scenarios of login, getNotes and CreateNote.

I have added dependencies as required.
